What is the amount of extra overhead per packet now sent? In other words, how much extra data (in bytes) did we add to the packet?
	We added two ints, a sequence and a checksum, therefore there is an additional 16 bytes (8 bytes per each int).	

If the current sequence number is 5, what should your sequence number be if the server received the incorrect checksum? What should it be if your server received the correct checksum
	it should still be 5 and the client should resend the same message. If the server received the correct checksum, it will increment the sequence number to 6 and request that one back from the client. 	

How could we ensure the packets were delivered to the application in the correct order while allowing the client to not be blocked by a recvfrom call? (No code, just ideas).
		The Server can have a buffer to hold multiple packets at once. This way, it can receive messages out of order.

What are some other ways to check the correctness of packets?
	We can use methods such as CRC or Two Dimentional Parity to check our packets.
